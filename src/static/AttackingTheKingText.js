  header: 'Attacking the King',
  body: `
        The most exciting phase of the game of chess is the attacks leading to
        checkmate or to the gain of substantial material. In this chapter, you
        will be able to review a number of different patterns for attacking an
        opponent. By playing through these patterns, you will learn to recognize
        such possibilities in your own game—either how to bring about the
        attacks or how to stop them.
        In almost every section, you will see that the black King, as checkmate
        approaches, has no moves. As a general rule, when your opponent's
        King cannot move, all you need is check! Many strong players use this
        rule. When they reach positions in which their opponent's King cannot
        move, they know that they can safely sacrifice considerable material if
        they can find a way to deliver the final blow.
        Note: As I did in the later sections of Chapter 12, "Elementary
        Checkmates," I again show these checkmates move by move, starting
        the move numbering with "1." Again, these move numbers are not
        indicative of a start-to-finish game, but are instead used to easily illustrate
        the order of the moves necessary to achieve these checkmates.

                        Are you wondering why the black player would have allowed such a powerful
                        move? The actual checkmate usually begins in a position like this
                        one. As you can see, the black Rook is not on g8 and would certainly not
                        want to move there voluntarily.
                        White begins by moving the Ng5-f7, giving check to the black King. The
                        King has no choice but to move out of the corner to g8.

                        capture the white Knight with the g7-pawn because the black King is
                        also in check from the Queen.
                        Black must move its King, but not to f8 where the white Queen, supported
                        by the Nh6, would deliver checkmate with 3.Qb3-f7. The black King therefore
                        retreats back into the corner.

                        Here is a somewhat more challenging example of the back rank checkmate.
                        Notice first that white has three attacks on the black f7-pawn, while
                        black has only two defenses. White could therefore begin with 1.Ra7xf7,
                        although there would be no immediate checkmate if black responded
                        with Rg6-f6.
                        White begins instead with the neat Queen sacrifice on f7 (Qf2xf7+). In
                        check, black cannot simply retreat the King into the corner or white will
                        checkmate quickly with 2.Qf7xf8 checkmate. Black therefore must capture
                        the Queen with Rf8xf7.

                        would simply capture the Queen. Black therefore blocks the check by

                        The f7-pawn, defended only by the black King, is black's weakest pawn.
                        Black could decline the sacrifice and opt not to recapture with the King,

                        Because black is unable to use a piece to capture
                        on f6 or to defend the g7-pawn, black
                        will have to respond with g7-g6, further weakening
                        the Kingside. As you know, every pawn

                        Although down a Queen, white has a mate in
                        two moves! White continues with the pawn
                        capture on f7, check, taking advantage of the
                        centralized Knight on e5, which now defends
                        the f7-Bishop. The King has only one legal
                        move, to e7.

                        In the final position, the white pieces harmoniously
                        cooperate to cover all of the King's
                        possible moves. The Nc3-d5 delivers the
                        checkmate by attacking the King and by covering
                        the f6 escape square. The Ne5 covers d7
                        and f7, while the Bf7 covers e8 and e6. It's
                        checkmate!
