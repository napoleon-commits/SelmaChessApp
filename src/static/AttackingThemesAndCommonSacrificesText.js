  header: 'Attacking Themes and Common Sacrifices',
  body: `
        Middlegame attacks are often the most exciting phase of the chess
        game. In this chapter, you will be able to review a number of different
        strategic themes for attacking an opponent. By playing through these
        patterns, you will be able to recognize such possibilities in your own
        gameâ€”either to bring them about or, if you are being attacked, to be
        able to prevent them. Just as important, you should be able to get a
        sense that successful attacks require careful coordination among many
        pieces, not just one or two.
        Sacrifices are special kinds of attacks in which one player gives
        up or "sacrifices" material, perhaps as little as a pawn or as much as a
        Queen, in order to generate an attack. This chapter will review a number
        of common sacrifices that can occur in your own games.
        In almost every case, attacks and sacrifices occur because one
        player is better developed than the other. For example, you might be
        able to mobilize many pieces around your opponent's King. Or perhaps
        if you remove one of the key defensive pieces, even at a high price, it
        will open direct lines against your opponent's King.
        As attacks develop, you will often see that a King, as checkmate
        approaches, has no moves. As a general rule, when your opponent's
        King can't move, all you need is check! Many strong players use this
        rule. When you reach positions in which the opponent's King can't
        move, know that you can safely sacrifice material if you can find a way
        to deliver the final checkmate.

                        Here is a typical Dragon position. Notice that white has castled on the Queenside in order to use both Rooks in the Kingside
                        attack. The white Be3 and the Qd2 are both pointed aggressively toward the weak h6-square. The white pawn on f3 discourages
                        black from moving its e5-Knight to g4, where the Knight might attack the Be3 and help defend the h6-square. The f3-
                        pawn also supports the g4-pawn. Note too that white has taken the useful precaution of moving the King from c1 to b1. It's
                        good advice to safeguard your King from possible checks before you commence an attack.
                        In this position, white has at least two excellent options. There is Be3-h6, seeking to exchange the dark-squared Bishops and
                        leaving the black King without a key defender. White could also play h2-h4, rushing the h-pawn forward toward h5 in an
                        effort to pry open the h-file for use by the Rh1 and a Queen after Qd2-h2.

                        In this position, one move later, white has
                        begun the attack with Be3-h6 while Black,
                        eager to counterattack, has played b7-b5.
                        White now presses forward with h2-h4,
                        threatening to push the h-pawn forward again
                        to h5. Notice the usefulness of playing g2-g4
                        first. The pawn on g4 discouraged black from
                        trying to defend with h7-h5.
                        Black has a terrible choice to make. If black
                        captures the Bishop on h6, the white Queen
                        will recapture and lead the attack on h6. If
                        black declines to capture on h6, white will be
                        able to capture on g7, which forces the black
                        King to recapture on g7.

                        counterplay on the Queenside with Qd8-a5.
                        White will now continue the attack with h4-h5.
                        The idea, of course, is to open up the h-file
                        with h5xg6 and then with Qd2-h6 check. These
                        attacks are very powerful and fun to play.

                        In this position, black has again chosen to
                        castle on the Kingside, but this time the Bf8
                        has developed to e7. Black's Kingside is much
                        more secure because black has avoided the
                        Kingside fianchetto. Nonetheless, white continues
                        as before. White has successfully developed
                        most of its pieces, with the Be3 and
                        Qd2 powerfully pointing toward the Kingside.
                        Once again, the pawn on f3 prevents Nf6-g4
                        and supports the beginning of an attack with
                        g2-g4-g5.
                        After you have completed or nearly completed
                        your development, you will need to make a
                        decision about the nature of your attack. Will
                        the attack be led by your pawns or by your
                        pieces? That interesting decision gets easier
                        with experience. In this position, white will
                        lead the charge with the g-pawn, playing g2-
                        g4. The idea is to push the pawn to g5, where
                        the g-pawn will attack the Nf6 and force this
                        key defender of the black Kingside to move
                        away.

                        to g5. Black has countered with b7-b5 with
                        the idea of b5-b4 attacking the white Nc3.
                        Black has an awkward choice in this position.
                        The black Nf6 could retreat to e8 or move to
                        the dim rim at h5.

                        and then on to g3, where it attacks the undefended
                        Nh5. Black dare not defend the Knight
                        with g7-g6 because, after Ng3xh5, the resulting
                        pawn recapture would drastically weaken
                        the black Kingside. If, instead, black captures
                        the Ng3, white will recapture with the h2-
                        pawn, opening up the h-file for a forceful
                        attack.

                        has played Qd2-h2 with the powerful threat
                        of Qxh7 checkmate. Black can stop the checkmate
                        by advancing the h-pawn, but that additional
                        Kingside weakness will leave white with
                        an enormous edge and an easy way to continue

                        Here is a position that might have occurred
                        had black retreated the Nf6-e8 rather than
                        play Nf6-h5. Note that white has advanced
                        the h2-pawn to h5. The h-pawn was needed
                        on h2 in the event that white had to play Nc3-
                        e2-g3. Here, the black Knight is on e8 rather
                        than h5. White has therefore rushed the
                        h-pawn to h5, where it can support the additional
                        pawn advance, g5-g6.
                        White's strategy is becoming clear. Black will
                        not be able to use the f7-pawn to capture on
                        g6 because the f7-pawn is required to defend
                        against the threat Nd4xe6 forking the Qd8
                        and the Rf8. Black can prevent the advance
                        of the white g-pawn by playing g7-g6, but that
                        move would weaken the f6 and h6 squares
                        and permit white to open the h-file for its
                        Rook and Queen with h5xg6. In both of these
                        English attack examples, white opens up the
                        h-file for an attack from the heavy pieces,
                        the Rooks and the Queen.

                        opening variation provides a quick attack that
                        many players enjoy. The moves 1.e2-e4 e7-e5,
                        2.Ng1-f3 Nb8-c6, and 3.Bf1-c4 Ng8-f6 are the

                        the powerful threat of Ng5xf7. To prevent the
                        threat, black usually plays d7-d5, blocking

                        Having already sacrificed a Knight, white sacrifices

                        White is down considerable material, but note
                        that white now has three attacks on the black
                        Nd5 while black has only two defenders. In
                        compensation for the sacrifice of a Knight and

                        Are the sacrifices correct? That question has
                        haunted chess players for more than 400
                        years. Many books have been written on this
                        subject, and still the answer is not yet clear.
                        What is clear is that this type of sacrificial play
                        is very exciting and a joy to play. By all means
                        try to prove the soundness of the sacrifice. Or
                        join the many players who are convinced that
                        the Fried Liver is unsound. Either way, you will
                        have become yet another chess player with
                        an opinion about this exciting line.

                        Many of these sacrifices work because one
                        side has far better development than the
                        other. This is certainly true here. White has
                        successfully advanced the e-pawn to e5,
                        attacking black's Nf6, which has retreated to
                        d7. As a result, the black Knight is no longer

                        notably the h7-square.
                        White begins by playing with Bd3xh7 check.
                        Only the King can recapture. Black is not
                        required to recapture, but moving the King
                        to h8 would lose the h7-pawn with no compensation
                        and only invite additional moves
                        like Nf3-g5 and Qd1-h5 for a powerful attack.
                        Black therefore captures the Bishop with

                        It is readily apparent that white has good
                        control over the center in this position. The
                        two center pawns are unopposed, and white's
                        Nf3 and Bc4 are already actively placed. By
                        contrast, black has fianchettoed the Bg7 and
                        developed the Queen's Knight to d7. Black's
                        last move, Nb8-d7, probably should have

                        the center and to prepare for castling.
                        White can now take advantage of black's lack
                        of development by playing the impressive
                        Bc4xf7 check. Black can decline this Bishop
                        sacrifice offer with Ke8-f8, but white would
                        then simply be ahead a pawn with a nice

                        White is down material in this position, but
                        there is significant compensation. Black's King
                        is exposed to attack, and white has the development
                        to take advantage of black's weaknesses.
                        White plays Nf3-g5 check. In response,
                        the black King has three choices. Retreating to

                        In the Dragon variation, to break through to
                        the King, white often must sacrifice a Rook for
                        a Knight. For example, in this position, white
                        would like to checkmate quickly with Qh6xh7,
                        but the black Nf6 is defending the h7-square.
                        White therefore begins by advancing the g4-pawn to g5, kicking the Nf6. The Knight must
                        move or be captured. Black therefore plays
                        Nf6-h5, blocking the h-file and continuing to
                        prevent white from checkmating on h7.

                        To break through to the King, white continues
                        the attack with an exchange sacrifice, Rh1xh5.
                        Obviously, the move offers the Rh1 for the
                        Nh5, but it succeeds in breaking up the black
                        Kingside and setting up the final checkmate.
                        Faced with the threat of Qh6xh7 and needing
                        compensation for the loss of the Knight, black
                        recaptures with g6xh5.

                        move permits white to threaten Qh6xh7
                        checkmate. Black could defend against
                        the checkmate by sacrificing the Rf8 on f7,
                        but after g6xf7 check, white would have a
                        significant material advantage. Instead, black
                        captures the pawn on g6 with h7xg6.

                        There are many ways for white to finish the

                        Rd1-g1, with the threats of Qg6-g7 checkmate,

                        players with the black pieces would probably
                        resign after Rd1-g1.

                        Not all sacrifices and victories in the Dragon
                        variation are played by white. Here is a typical
                        exchange sacrifice that will help the player
                        with the black pieces gain a victory or two.
                        In this position, white has begun an attack
                        on the black Kingside with h2-h4-h5 and
                        with Be3-h6. Black has responded by posting
                        the Queen aggressively on a5 and by doubling
                        the Rooks on the c-file. Note that black
                        would like to play Qa5xa2, but the white
                        Nc3 is defending the a-pawn. Black therefore
                        begins with Rc7xc3, an exchange sacrifice that
                        removes a key defender. White could ignore
                        the capture with a move like Bh6xg7, but
                        white decides instead to accept the exchange
                        sacrifice with b2xc3.

                        As you can see, the sacrifice of the exchange

                        around the white King. The c-pawns are doubled.
                        Black has two attacks on the c3-pawn,
                        which is defended only by the white Queen.
                        Rather than capture the c3-pawn, black

                        guard the a1-square and prevent the immediate
                        checkmate, white responds with Nd4-b3.
