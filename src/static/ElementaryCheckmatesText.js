        To win a chess game, you must deliver a checkmate (or mate, for
        short)â€”placing your opponent's King in check with the King having no
        legal move. In this chapter, you will be able to explore all the most basic
        checkmates. As you will see, some of these checkmates are very simple.
        In fact, if you're clever enough to Queen a pawn, the checkmate with
        two Queens against a lone King is easy and fun to do. The other checkmates
        in this chapter are somewhat more challenging, but with a bit of
        practice, you'll be able to deliver checkmate with just a Rook or even
        with a King, Bishop, and Knight.
        You will also learn to recognize when there is insufficient material
        to deliver a checkmate. That way, you won't play on and on, trying to do
        the impossible. Or perhaps when you're trailing, you will be able to
        reach such an endgame and avoid a loss.

                        Here is the basic checkmate. With white to move, white can deliver a check on several squares, but the move Qb6-b8 is
                        checkmate. On b8, the Queen will be attacking the black King, which cannot escape from the attack. Note that the Queen on
                        a7 controls all of the squares of the 7th rank while, after Qb6-b8, the Queen on b8 controls all of the squares of the 8th rank.

                        The simplest method for this checkmate is
                        illustrated here. The technique is a bit like
                        walking a dog, forcing the King step by step
                        toward the top edge of the board. Here, white
                        has many paths to the checkmate, but the
                        simplest is clearly Qb4-b6, attacking the lone
                        King. The King must retreat to the 7th rank.

                        Here, after the retreat of the King to d7, white
                        will continue to force the King toward the top
                        of the board by playing Qa5-a7. Note that,
                        given the power of the white Queens, the
                        black King is unable to approach the Queens
                        in an effort to prevent the checkmate.
                        After Qa5-a7, you will be in the same position
                        illustrated at the beginning of this section (see
                        the previous page). As you can see, checkmating
                        with two Queens is relatively simple.

                        Here is another example of a checkmate with
                        two Queens. White could simply proceed
                        with the technique we just reviewed, but
                        there is a much faster and more elegant
                        checkmate. The Qb5 controls the 5th rank
                        while the Qc3 controls the 3rd rank.
                        White begins with Qb5-e5 check. Note that,
                        after the check, black has only a single legal
                        move, to g4.

                        White completes the checkmate by playing

                        the Qg3. It is a beautiful checkmate!
                        In many chess games, however, you might not
                        have the luxury of having so much extra material.
                        In the following sections, we will explore
                        checkmates with less material.

                        In bringing about the checkmate with your
                        King and Queen, there are two key moves

                        checkmate with Qb6-b8. However, Qb6-d6
                        is a move that many players make without
                        realizing the danger.
                        With the white Queen on d6, black has been
                        stalemated! Black of course must move, but
                        black has no legal move and the black King is
                        not in check. Note that stalemate applies only
                        when one side has no legal move whatsoever.
                        For more on stalemates, see the section
                        "Stalemates and Other Draws" in Chapter 2.
                        There are many positions in which the King
                        or another piece cannot move. It is only a
                        stalemate if one side is not in check and has
                        no legal moves anywhere on the board.

                        with the Queen. This strategy speaks to the key
                        of all of these King and Queen checkmates: To
                        win, the King and Queen must work together
                        in harmony. Instead, white blundered with
                        Qa7-f7?, again with a stalemate.
                        Notice that the black King is not in check. But
                        because of the bad move by the white Queen,
                        the black King has no legal moves.

                        Here is the basic checkmate. The Rf8 is checking

                        in the King and Queen endgames, the white

                        Backing up just one move, the checkmate in

                        sure that the black King does not escape to
                        the Queenside. White therefore plays Rf7-f1.

                        Checkmating with a King and Rook is easy once the King is in the corner.
                        Here's how you can force the enemy King into the corner. Notice that the
                        white Re5 has already placed the black King in a box. The Rook controls
                        e6, e7, and e8, as well as the key squares on the 5th rank: f5, g5, and h5.
                        The black King is trapped inside those squares and has only nine squares
                        at its disposal (f6, f7, f8, g6, g7, g8, h6, h7, and h8).
                        To make some headway, the white King and Rook must work together.
                        White begins with Ke4-f4, waiting for the black King to move backward.

                        (g6, g7, g8, h6, h7, and h8). Therefore, black decides to move instead to f7.

                        Here is the final checkmate. Note that the white King controls the g7 and h7 escape squares. The Nh6 plays a key role in controlling
                        g8. And of course, the Bd4 is delivering the final check. The key to this endgame is that the checkmate can be forced
                        only in the corner that the Bishop can control. Players with the lone King should therefore run into the "wrong" corner and
                        see if their opponent can figure out how to force the checkmate.

                        Please note that it is not possible to force a checkmate with just a Bishop or just a Knight. Even with a King and two Knights,
                        no checkmate can be forced. In this position, white will be able to deliver checkmate if black plays the Kg8 into the h8-corner.
                        But black can avoid all trouble simply by playing Kg8-f8.
