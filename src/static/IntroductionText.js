                        Chess is played between two players, one in control of the white pieces and one in control of the black pieces. White always has the first move.
                        To decide who gets white and who gets black, it is customary for one player to hide a white and black pawn in each hand. The other player then picks a hand. Whoever picks or is left with the white pawn will get the white pieces and will move first.
                        In the second diagram, white is advancing one of its pawns by moving it forward two squares. As you will soon see, this pawn move helps control the key squares in the very center of the chessboard and permits one of white's Bishops as well as the white Queen to move out.

                        Using the names of the squares helps us to discuss the board in a very simple, clear manner. For example, in this position, the white Queen is on b1, the black Queen is on e5, and a black Bishop is on d7. White has pawns on c3 and c4. Take a moment to locate them. As you will see, it's very easy.
                        A numeral and period at the beginning of a notation indicates the move number. For example, in the game shown here, white's first move was pawn e2 to e4. This is notated 1 e2 to e4. You will see this type of notation starting in Chapter 8, Opening Strategy.

                        Notation also permits us to talk about the movement of pieces. Remember, pieces are abbreviated as follows: K for King, Q for Queen, B for Bishop, N for Knight, and R for Rook (there isn't an abbreviation for pawn).

                        In this position, white has just moved the Queen from d1 to b1. In this app, the long form of the notation is used, "Qd1-b1," but many chess players abbreviate the move with "Qb1." As a result of white's move, the white Queen on b1 is suddenly attacking the black pawn on b6. As you can see, it's not very hard to find the black b6-pawn. To defend the b6-pawn, black might now play Re8-b8, moving the black Rook from the e8-square to b8.

                        Captures are simply recorded with an "x." And so in this position, if black were to move the black Queen on e5 to capture the white pawn on e4, you would write: Qe5xe4. Of course, that awful Queen move would result in losing the black Queen to the white Bishop (Bc2xe4).
                        When a move results in check, an attack on the enemy King, this is indicated with a "+" at the end of the notation. When a move results in checkmate, this is indicated with a "#" at the end of the move.

                        In this example, recapturing is illustrated with pawns. Black is about to move the pawn on d5 to capture the white pawn on e4. Not to fear. As long as white is alert, black will not "win" the pawn. Rather, white can simply move the Knight to e4 to recapture the pawn.

                        In this position, the situation is more complicated because more pieces have moved, but the idea of recapturing is the same. Black moves the Knight on a5 to capture the white Bishop on c4. White could respond with many moves, but white should recapture with the white pawn on d3. If white fails to recapture, black will simply move the Knight back to safety and will have taken the white Bishop without losing a thing. It may be hard to believe, but good players will almost always win the game if you give them the advantage of an extra Knight or Bishop.
