        If both sides have played with reasonable care, the result at the end
        of the game is often what appears at first to be a very simple position.
        There are just one or two pieces on the board and perhaps just a handful
        of pawns. As you will see in this chapter, it is possible to gain victory
        with just a small advantage. You will learn how to win with an extra
        pawn, and hopefully, how to draw if you are down a pawn.
        The strategies in this chapter are relatively straightforward, but they
        form a solid foundation for your middlegame strategy. Perhaps you will
        be able to exchange pieces to reach a position similar to one in this
        chapter. Transitions to favorable endgames are at the heart of a master's
        strategy. Many beginning players prefer to spend their time learning
        opening variations. Strong players often begin at the end, mastering the
        subtleties of these endgames in the expectation that their opponents
        will not know what to do in this phase of the game.
        No one will expect that you will study endgames for years, but having
        knowledge of the positions in this chapter will help you to play your
        endgames with much more confidence. Throughout this chapter, you'll
        also find helpful sidebars highlighting basic endgame principles that
        you need to keep in mind as you play and learn.

                        This first position is worth remembering because, no matter whose move
                        it is, white will successfully be able to promote the pawn. As you can see,
                        the white King is in front of the pawn. That's the key! In this position, if
                        it is black's move, the black King must move to either d8 or to f8. Either
                        way, the poor King must leave the square on which the white pawn will
                        be promoted. White will then be able to move the King forward to gain
                        control over the Queening square.

                        In this position, after just one move, the situation has become completely
                        clear. White has complete control over the key e8-square as well as the e6
                        and e7 squares through which the white pawn will now travel. White will
                        successfully promote the pawn into a Queen and then proceed with a
                        King and Queen to deliver the checkmate we reviewed in Chapter 12,

                        the King to d6 or f6, making way to push the pawn forward. Whichever
                        direction the white King selects, black will move in the same direction,
                        attempting to prevent the white King from moving forward and capturing
                        easy control over the e8-Queening square.

                        To make it simpler to calculate long sequences, chess players have introduced

                        In this position, the white pawn is moving toward the h8-Queening square.
                        You can see that the white h-pawn needs just three more moves to reach
                        the h8-Queening square, while the black King needs four moves to reach h8.
                        To make it simpler to see if the King can capture the pawn, imagine that
                        the white pawn forms a four by four square.

                        Most rules have exceptions. Here are two special cases. This is the same
                        diagram as above, but with the addition of a black pawn on f6. The black
                        King can enter the square of the white pawn but will not be able to do so
                        again as the white pawn advances. The reason, of course, is that the black
                        pawn on f6 is blocking the black King's path toward the h8-Queening
                        square.

                        Here is a second exception. It certainly appears at first glance that the
                        black King will be able to reach the white pawn. The square is larger, and
                        after white moves h2-h3, the black King would indeed be able to reach
                        the pawn in time. However, white can begin with h2-h4! Suddenly, by
                        moving ahead two squares, the black King will be unable to reach the
                        pawn.

                        You have already seen that using the opposition can help you to draw
                        against a King and a pawn. The opposition can also help you to win. In
                        this position, white could try to advance the h-pawn quickly, but after h2-
                        h4 black would be able to enter the square of the pawn with Kd3-e4 and
                        eventually capture it.
                        Rather than advance the h-pawn directly, white should instead take the
                        opposition with Kc5-d5, blocking the black King's access to the e4-square.
                        Black will therefore continue with Kd3-e3 in an effort to reach the white

                        same holds true here. In this position, white is threatening to play Ke5-e6.
                        Black could try to check the white King with Ra2-e2, but the white King
                        could escape check by moving in front of the pawn on d6. Similarly, after
                        Ke5-e6, black could check the King with Ra2-a6. But white would simply
                        advance the pawn to d6, with the terrible threat of Rb1-b8 checkmate!
                        With black to move, in order to draw, black must play Ra2-a6 to prevent
                        the white King from moving in front of its pawn. White can move the
                        Rook around for a while, but so long as black's Rook maintains control
                        over the 6th rank, the white King will not be able to move in front of its
                        pawn. To make progress, white will therefore have to advance the d5-pawn to d6.

                        As soon as white advances the d-pawn, black must move the Rook back

                        White can play Ke5-e6, threatening checkmate with Rb1-b8, but black will
                        be able to draw.

                        simple draw. Rather than Ra2-a8 to defend the checkmate, black decides
                        to check the white King with Ra2-e2. Note that, with the pawn on d6,
                        there's simply no place for white to escape a never ending series of
                        checks. If white decides to approach the black Rook with the King, black
                        will be able to approach and then capture the d6-pawn with Ke8-d7.

                        The major difference between this position and the last is that the white
                        King already controls the Queening square on e8. Note, however, that the
                        white King cannot legally move off to one side and then Queen the pawn.
                        For the moment at least, the white King cannot move because the black
                        King defends d8 and d7, and the black Rook defends f8 and f7.
                        In order to win, white must drive back the black King and then find a
                        clever way to shield the white King from attacks by the black Rook. White
                        begins by playing Rh2-c2 check, forcing the black King to retreat to the
                        b-file.

                        e4-square. Chess players call this "building a bridge." Black responds to
                        white's Rc2-c4 by moving its King to b6, hoping to advance to b5 to attack
                        the c4-Rook.

                        White's Bishop can travel only on the dark squares. As such, the two
                        Bishops will never be able to attack each other.
                        Endgames that involve Bishops of opposite color are so drawish (or likely

                        In endgames with Bishops of opposite color, it is much easier to win
                        when the two pawns are separated by several files because the defending
                        side cannot easily blockade both pawns. In this position, black is blockading
                        the white c6-pawn with the King, but that leaves only the Bg7 to prevent
                        white from advancing and promoting the g4-pawn.
                        White's strategy is simple. Force the black King to commit to stopping
                        one of the pawns and then use the white King to assist the advance of
                        the other pawn. Here, white begins with Ke4-f5, moving toward the

                        Therefore, black decides to move the Bishop along the long a1-h8 diagonal

                        When it is able to control a square through which a passed pawn must
                        travel, the Knight obviously has the ability to prevent the promotion of the
                        pawn.
                        However in this position, the Knight is unable to blockade the pawn. It's
                        white's move. Because white must prevent black from capturing the h5-pawn with Ng7xh5, white advances its pawn to h6 to attack the black
                        Knight.
                        There is no square that the Knight can move to that will help to prevent
                        the pawn from reaching h8. Black instead tries to race the King toward h8
                        by playing Ke8-f8, and in turn, defending the Knight.

                        In this key position, white would make a significant error by capturing the

                        Instead, white cleverly continues to advance the pawn to h7. Notice that
                        the pawn on h7 prevents the black King from moving to g8 where it
                        would be closer to the h7-pawn. The Knight is also unable to prevent the
                        h7-pawn from promoting to a Queen on h8.

                        Unlike the endgame with a Bishop and pawn when the pawn does not
                        always promote, the Knight
                        will never have a problem controlling the Queening square so the pawn
                        will always be able to promote to a Queen.
                        In this position, white needs only to be careful not to stalemate the black
                        King. For example, if white pushes the h6-pawn to h7, the black King will
                        not be in check and will not have a legal move. The result will be a stalemate,
                        an unfortunate draw for white.
                        To win, white should begin by playing Ng5-f7 check to drive the black
                        King from the Queening square to g8.

                        As you should expect, the Queen will almost always be able to prevent a
                        pawn from Queening. In this example, the black pawn is only two squares

                        the board but more advanced. The Queen can succeed again, but this
                        time only with help from the King.
                        In this position, black is ready to promote the pawn on e1. The white

                        draw once the black King recaptured.
