  body: `
        The King and Queen are the two strongest pieces. The Queen has tremendous scope, especially in the open board, but it is important not to bring the Queen out too early. If you do, you might find that your opponent is able to attack the Queen and make it move again and again, often a clear waste of time.
        The King, of course, is the most important piece. If it is attacked and has no escape, you lose the game. Therefore, you typically want to safeguard your King before you begin your attacks. In most games, you will usually want to castle to safeguard your King and activate a Rook. Once castled, try not to move the pawns in front of your King. As you saw in Chapter 6, every pawn move creates weaknesses that your opponent may be able to exploit.

                        In this position, black has developed the Queen before bringing out any of the black Knights, Bishops, or Rooks. As a result, white has a very strong move, developing the Knight on b1 to c3 (Nb1-c3). The Knight develops to a strong natural square and, at the same time, attacks the Queen. The Queen, a much more valuable piece than the white Knight, will have to move again.

                        Some players might simply retreat the black Queen to its starting square. Imagine, however, that black decides to move the Queen to e5 giving check (Qd5-e5+). Here, white has responded to the check from the Queen by developing the light-squared Bishop to e2 (Bf1-e2). Then, with white to move, white can bring out another piece, in this case the Knight on g1 to f3 yet again attacking the black Queen. As you can see, white is busy developing pieces actively while black is forced to make moves again and again with the Queen.

                        In this position, white has broken the rule and posted the white Queen very aggressively on just the second move of the game. At first glance, you might wonder why the move is so bad. After all, the Queen attacks the undefended black pawn on e5. The Queen's move, however, offers black a simple way to develop effectively. First, black can defend the e5-pawn by developing the Knight on b8 to c6 (Nb8-c6). On the next move, black can simply advance the g-pawn to g6, gaining time by attacking the Queen and getting ready to develop the Knight from g8 to f6 and the Bishop from f8 to g7.

                        White takes advantage of black's poor development by capturing the pawn on f5 (e4xf5). At first glance, it would appear that white has made a terrible mistake. After all, black can now capture the white pawn on g2 with the light-squared Bishop (Bb7xg2). That move certainly looks like it will win the white Rook on h1.
                        However, white has a very powerful response that takes advantage of the undeveloped black King. White plays the Queen to h5, giving check (Qd1-h5+). As you can see, the King cannot move. Black has no choice but to block the check by advancing the g-pawn (g7-g6).

                        As this next position shows, white has continued the attack by capturing the black g6-pawn with the white pawn on f5 (f5xg6). Black simply does not have time to capture the white Rook on h1 because any move by the white pawn on g6 will be checkmate!
                        Black therefore decides to develop the Knight on g8 to f6 (Ng8-f6), attacking the white Queen. White now has a fabulous checkmate in two more moves. White continues with pawn take pawn (g6xh7), sacrificing the Queen to the f6 Knight!

                        Here, white has castled on the Queenside, while black has castled on the Kingside. White gains an advantage because the white Rook lands on an open file. But the white King has a bit more space to defend. An attack by black on the white a-pawn might require white to move the King again or to advance the a-pawn. And, of course, after castling on the Queenside, the white King is exposed on the c1-h6 diagonal
                        By contrast, black's King is slightly safer. The King is not exposed to any checks, and all of black's Kingside pawns are defended. However, unlike the white Rook, the black Rook is usually not on an open file after castling on the Kingside.

                        In this example, white has castled Queenside and taken the added precaution of moving the King further to b1. On c1, the King would rest on a file that black is likely to use to double the black Rooks. By castling on the Queenside, white is able to advance the Kingside pawns forward in a menacing way. White might continue, for example, by advancing the g- or h-pawn again.

                        Black has castled Kingside here, and is not without possibilities. With black to move, black would likely advance the b-pawn to attack the white Knight (b5-b4). There are good attacking chances for both sides in this position. White will be attempting to coordinate an attack on black's Kingside with moves like g5-g6 and Qd2-h2. Black must not wait for the attack, but rather move aggressively against the white King with moves such as b5-b4, Rf8-c8, and perhaps Nc6-e5-c4.

                        White has many different moves that might take advantage of these weaknesses. For example, white might move the Queen to c3 or to h6, threatening to deliver checkmate with the Queen on the g7 square. Or white might simply advance the h-pawn to h5 in an effort to open the h-file and to blow apart the black Kingside. Generally speaking, the more moves made in front of a castled King, the more vulnerable the King will be.

                        In this second example, black has weakened the Kingside by advancing the h-pawn to h6. As a result, white has at least two plans for breaking through. First, white could simply challenge the black h6-pawn by playing g4 to g5. Note that the white h-pawn, the Rook, and the Queen all support the g4 to g5 advance. But let's consider an interesting alternative. The advance of the black h-pawn has created a short pawn chain. The black h6-pawn is the strong pawn in the chain. By contrast, the black pawn on g7 is the weak pawn in the chain. White might therefore consider the pawn move f5 to f6.

And black's third option of leaving the pawn on g7 would, of course, permit the f6 to g7 pawn capture, (f6xg7). Things don't look good for black.
