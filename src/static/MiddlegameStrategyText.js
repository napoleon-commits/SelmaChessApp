        Many players memorize long opening variations but have little or no
        idea how to proceed once they get to the middle of a game. You already
        know about having good and bad pieces, placing Rooks on open files,
        placing the Knights in the center where the enemy pawns can't attack
        them, and trying to avoid bad Bishops. In this chapter, I offer four basic
        principles and strategies that will help you integrate many of these
        ideas.
        Aron Nimzovitsch, a great German Grandmaster of the early 20th
        century, introduced new ways of thinking about chess. His chess classic,
        My System, is a long and complex book that was awkwardly translated
        to English. In the first section, I introduce his five steps to victory in an
        easy-to-understand manner.
        In the second section, I introduce two important ways of approaching
        your thought process in every chess game. The first, the idea of
        selecting and considering options, at least three "candidate moves," was
        popularized in Alexander's Kotov's 1971 classic Think Like a Grandmaster.
        The idea is simple enough. In every position, consider not one move but
        at least three. Or, as the great player Emanuel Lasker put it, "When you
        see a good move, look for a better one."
        In the third section, I offer an important way of thinking about
        "threats." Before every move, consider whether your opponent is threatening
        to do something important. In response, you must either turn off
        the threat or else find a threat that is more significant. And finally, in the
        fourth section, I emphasize the importance of recapturing after someone
        captures one of your pieces.

                    The first step is simple enough. You will win
                    many games if you train yourself to be aware
                    of and to quickly identify all of your opponent's
                    pawn weaknesses. In this example, the
                    two central black pawns on d6 and e5 form a
                    pawn chain. As you saw in Chapter 6, "Pawn
                    Strategy," the backward pawn at d6 is the
                    weaker of the two pawns because no pawn
                    can defend it. Black's d6-pawn represents a
                    key weakness in the black pawn structure.
                    Having identified the key weakness on d6,
                    you are ready for step 2.

                        The second step is quite simple. To prevent
                        black from pushing the d6-pawn to d5, white
                        must fix black's weakness by occupying or
                        controlling the d5-square.
                        In Chapter 4, "Knight Strategy," you learned
                        that it is advantageous to place Knights in the
                        center of the board where they can't be
                        attacked by pawns. Here, you can see that it
                        would be helpful to place a Knight—or another
                        piece, for that matter—in the "hole" at d5.
                        By moving the Knight to d5, or even by using
                        the Knight to control d5, you will prevent
                        black from eliminating the d6-pawn weakness
                        by pushing the pawn from d6 to d5. In this
                        figure, white controls the key d5-square with
                        both the Knight on e3 and the pawn on e4. If
                        black were to push the d6-pawn to d5, white
                        would be able to win it. With the Knight on
                        e3, the pawn on d6 has been fixed because
                        it can't successfully move without being lost.

                        Once you have identified and fixed the weakness,
                        it's time for step 3: Attack the weakness
                        with your pieces—not your pawns. In this
                        position, it is clear that white has successfully
                        arranged an attack on black's d6-pawn with
                        four different pieces, the doubled Rooks on
                        d2 and d3, the Queen on d1, and even the
                        dark-squared Bishop on a3. Notice that
                        white's attack has been patient in that the
                        Queen is not leading the charge on d3 but
                        rather is attacking from the rear on d1. Strong
                        players know that it's often more effective to
                        have the less valuable pieces lead the attack.
                        As they say in boxing, "Don't lead with your
                        nose."

                        If you have successfully carried out the first
                        three steps, your opponent must carry out
                        step 4. For every one of your attacks on the
                        pawn weakness, your opponent will have
                        to find a defender. If your opponent fails to
                        defend the pawn adequately, look to take the
                        target-pawn first "with the little thing." What
                        "little thing," you ask? It depends on the position
                        but it is often a Knight or a Bishop.
                        In this position, white is still attacking black's
                        d6-pawn with four pieces, and black has
                        responded by defending the poor d6-pawn
                        with four pieces—Rd8, Rd7, Be7, and Qb8. As
                        a result, these pieces aren't very active.
                        Note that, as a result of the first four steps,
                        white has two active Rooks on a semi-open
                        file, while black's Rooks are stuck defending
                        the d6-pawn. White has a good Bishop on a3,
                        attacking the d6-pawn, while black's Be7 is
                        bad, stuck behind the fixed d6-pawn. Even
                        the white Queen on d1 is more active than its
                        black counterpart on b8.

                        By the time your opponent has completed step 4, he'll know that there's trouble ahead. Most or all of your pieces will be
                        active by focusing their energy on a single fixed point. By contrast, your opponent's pieces will be relatively weak, defending
                        rather than attacking a weakness.
                        For the final step, attack the weakness with a pawn. As you can see in this position, white has simply advanced the c4-pawn
                        to c5 and black is in a quandary. The black d6-pawn has three options. It can capture on c5, push forward to d5, or remain
                        where it is. We know that the pawn can't push forward to d5 because it is fixed. On d5, white would have four attacks on the
                        pawn while black would have only two defenses (the Rooks).
                        Instead, if black were to capture with d6xc5, white would suddenly have three attacks on the Rd7. Capturing the white pawn
                        would lose a black Rook.
                        Black could do nothing, but white would still have five attacks on the d6-pawn, and black would have only four defenses. On
                        white's next move, white would continue with c5xd6, winning the key black pawn.

                        by the black c5-pawn and the black Nc6. Black plays
                        Nc6-a7, threatening to capture Bb5 and, by forcing the
                        Bishop to move, gaining access for Rb8-b4. White

                        into the strategy by doubling the Rooks on the b-file.
                        Understanding black's strategy, white attempts to bring
                        the King closer to the b-pawn by playing Kf1-e1.

                        defender, the Rc3. White therefore plays Be2-d1, using
                        the Bishop to defend b3. There are now two attacks and
                        two defenses. The third attack will require that the black

                        would be vulnerable after Rb4xa4 because the b3-pawn
                        would be pinned and unable to recapture on a4 without
                        losing Rb1. White therefore plays Rc1-a1 with the idea

                        permitting the black Knight to move later toward the

                        Many beginners believe that the masters have trained themselves to think many moves ahead. The fact is that masters have
                        an advantage. Masters rarely calculate long forced sequences. Although some rely on intuition or an innate feel for the game,
                        most are able to plan ahead. They have a sense of where the strongest squares are and where each piece belongs. From
                        experience, they know how to conduct attacks and how to coordinate their pieces.
                        To illustrate the process, this section follows the ideas and considerations through 12 consecutive moves of a master game.
                        In this first position, white already has a tangible advantage. The move Nf3-g5 has already caused black to prevent Bd3xh7
                        with the move g7-g6, a pawn advance that has weakened the black Kingside. Notice that by moving the g-pawn forward, the
                        f6 and h6 squares are now weak. White would like to move the dark-squared Bishop on c1 to h6 where it would attack
                        the black Rf8 and also control the g7-square
                        in front of the black King. White would also
                        like to further weaken the black Kingside.
                        White therefore has two ideas. The first is
                        the move Qf3-h3 with the threat of Qh3xh7
                        checkmate (Ng5 would defend Qh7). The
                        threat of checkmate would require black
                        to weaken the Kingside with h7-h5. White
                        could also try Ng5-e4, which is a strong
                        looking move with the idea of both Ne4-f6
                        check as well as opening the Bc1's path to
                        the h6 square.
                        Both plans are legitimate. Although you
                        should keep in mind the principle that
                        when two moves look good, one is always
                        better than the other. In this case, white
                        plays Qf3-h3 in order to further weaken
                        the black Kingside.

                        As you can see, black has prevented the
                        immediate checkmate by advancing the h7-pawn to h5, but the pawn move has further
                        weakened the black Kingside. It would now
                        be more difficult, for example, to drive the
                        Ng5 away, and the support for the g6-pawn
                        has been reduced.
                        White might again try Ng5-e4 with the idea
                        of Ne4-f6 check and Bc1-h6. That idea seems
                        even stronger now that the Kingside is weaker.
                        White could also try to advance the f-pawn to
                        f4 and then f5. Or white could play g2-g4 to try
                        to batter down the black Kingside.
                        White must decide whether to conduct a
                        pawn-led or a piece-led attack. Both pawn
                        moves weaken the white Kingside. White
                        therefore decides on the first course of action,
                        Ng5-e4, with the idea of activating the Bc1.
                        Black responds by capturing on d5 with the
                        Ne7. The Nd5 will be well posted in the center
                        of the board where the white pawns will not
                        be able to attack it.

                        White has three candidate moves in this
                        next position. White could capture the Bd6
                        with the Ne4. White could develop the Bc1
                        directly to h6, or white could play Bc1-g5.
                        Both Bishop moves take advantage of the
                        weak dark squares around the King.
                        White's move Ne4xBd6 is very tempting
                        because, in the open board, the Bishop has
                        considerable sway. However, the Knight is
                        a powerful piece in the center of the board
                        where, to drive it away, black would have to
                        play f7-f5, further weakening black's Kingside.
                        The most tempting move is white's Bc1-h6,
                        but white would lose quickly after this move
                        with black's Bb7-c8 attacking the white Queen.
                        In that position, the Queen would be quickly
                        trapped in the center of the board after Qh3-f3 and Bc8-g4.
                        Having seen the trap, white avoids it by first
                        playing the move Bc1-g5, attacking the black
                        Queen. To guard the Queen, black responds
                        with Bd6-e7.

                        After black's Bd6-e7, black is threatening
                        simply to capture the white Bg5. White therefore
                        has two options: capture the black Be7
                        or play the move Bg5-h6. Fortunately, after
                        Bg5-h6, black is no longer able to trap the
                        white Queen because, without the black
                        Bishop on d6, the Queen will have access to
                        the g3-square. Rather than exchange Bishops,
                        which would reduce the firepower aimed at
                        the black King, white plays Bg5-h6. This move,
                        of course, attacks the Rf8. Rather than move
                        the Rook, black plays Bb7-c8, attacking the
                        white Queen.

                        can move it to f3 or to g3. On f3, the Queen
                        would be subject to another attack with Bc8-g4. White therefore decides to play Qg3 where
                        the Queen, in conjunction with the Bd3, is
                        generating pressure on the weakened g6-pawn. Black responds by moving Rf8-e8, out
                        of danger from the attack from the Bh6.

                        White has many good moves in this position.
                        For example, white could activate the Ra1 to
                        c1 or the Rf1-e1. The Bd3 could move to b5
                        to attack the Re8. Or white could play Qg3-e5,
                        threatening checkmate in one move with
                        Qe5-g7. Both Rook moves look useful, but
                        masters know that Rook moves are often the
                        most difficult moves to make because it is
                        hard to know exactly where the Rooks belong.
                        White decides to play Qg3-e5, in part because
                        the move is very difficult to meet. After Qg3-e5
                        black can't respond with Be7-f6. White would
                        then play the amazing Qe5xNd5, seeing that
                        after black's Qd8xd5, white plays Ne4xBf6
                        check, forking the King, the e8-Rook, and the
                        black Queen on d5.
                        Black therefore must block the checkmate
                        by white's Queen on g7 by advancing the
                        f7-pawn to f6, yet another weakening of the
                        black Kingside. In this case, the f7-f6 move
                        weakens the now undefended g6-pawn.

                        Having forced yet another Kingside weakness,

                        the black g6-pawn. To defend it, black decides

                        White's strategy has worked very well. As a
                        result of carefully timed maneuvers, black's
                        Kingside is in shambles. However, black does
                        suddenly emerge with the idea of trapping
                        the Bh6 behind enemy lines. White could
                        develop one of its Rooks, but to take advantage
                        of the Bh6's advanced position, white
                        decides to play h2-h4. Note that the pawn on

                        g5-pawn. Under such pressure, black has no
                        choice but to push the g-pawn yet again.

                        This position represents the culmination of
                        white's initial strategy of forcing the black
                        Kingside pawns to advance. Having caused
                        the damage, white now considers the next
                        phase: how best to take advantage of the
                        open diagonals and the entry squares around
                        the black King.
                        White has many interesting options and, as
                        many strong players like to say, even a bad
                        plan is better than no plan. White could now
                        take aim on the a2-g8 diagonal with moves
                        such as Bd3-c4 and Qg3-b3. Alternatively,
                        white could begin with Ra1-c1 or Rf1-e1.
                        Another interesting option is Ra1-e1, with the
                        idea of advancing the f-pawn against black's
                        weak pawn structure.
                        White decides on the first plan of Bd3-c4,
                        putting pressure on the white center, pinning
                        the black Nd5 against the Kg8, and taking aim
                        on the e6 and f7 squares. Black responds, as
                        masters often do, by moving the King in order
                        to break the pin (Kg8-h7).

                        In this position, white faces the need to retreat
                        the Bh6. Retreating the Bishop to g5 would
                        lose the Bishop to the f6-pawn. Retreating
                        back to c1 makes little sense, because the
                        Ra1 will probably want to develop there. That
                        leaves d2, e3, and f4. The e3-square is relatively
                        inactive because of the fixed d4-pawn,
                        and, with a Bishop on e3, the Qg3 would be
                        blocked from the b3 square. White decides
                        to retreat the Bishop to d2 where, three
                        squares away from the centralized black
                        Nd5, the Bishop dominates the black Knight.
                        Fearful of white's activity and mindful of the
                        Kingside weaknesses, black responds with
                        Bc8-f5, attacking the undefended Ne4 and
                        immediately taking control over the b1-h7

                        With no reasonable retreat for the white Ne4,
                        white will need to defend it. Qg3-d3 is unacceptable
                        because white would not want to
                        walk into a pin. Retreating the Bc4-d3 blocks
                        the Queen's access to the b3 square and the
                        Bc4's real idea is to pressure the a2-g8 diagonal.
                        White therefore needs to choose between
                        Ra1-e1 or Rf1-e1. Ra1-e1 would probably
                        commit white to using the Rf1 to push the
                        f-pawn. Rf1-e1 would give white the opportunity
                        to use the Ra1 on the c-file.
                        White selects Rf1-e1 as the more flexible move.
                        Black responds with Bf5-g6 in an effort to fight
                        for control over the f7-square.

                        Qg3-b3—the most logical move. On b3, the
                        Queen augments the pressure along the a2-g8 diagonal. Black is simply unable to defend
                        the Knight a second time. If, for example, black
                        plays Bg6-f7, white can play Ne4-c3, a third
                        attack on the poor Nd5. If the black Knight
                        on d5 were to move, the black Bishop on f7
                        would fall.

                        after the moves 1.e2-e4 c7-c5, 2.Ng1-f3 Nb8-c6, 3.d2-d4 c5xd4, 4.Nf3xd4 Ng8-f6, 5.Nb1-c3
                        e7-e5. Black's last move, e7-e5, threatens on
                        the next move to capture white's Nd4. White
                        has many options for the Knight, including the
                        retreat to f3, but white prefers to play Nd4-b5,
                        where the Knight will threaten the move
                        Nb5-d6 check. Black responds by stopping
                        that threat with the move d7-d6.
                        You might recognize that black's central pawn
                        structure contains a weakness on d6 and a
                        central hole on d5. White would like to play
                        the move Nc3-d5 but the Nd5 would be captured
                        immediately by the strong Nf6. Rather
                        than play the move Nd5, white threatens to
                        play it by first moving Bc1-g5. The Bishop pins
                        the Nf6 to the black Queen and the threat of
                        Nc3-d5 is now real.

                        Strong players often say that "the threat
                        is stronger than the execution." They mean
                        that preparing the threat correctly (in this
                        position with Bc1-g5) is better than playing
                        the threat immediately (with Nc3-d5) as you
                        can see in this position.
                        After the move Bc1-g5, black has several
                        interesting candidate moves. Black could
                        un-pin immediately with Bf8-e7. Black could
                        guard the d5-square with Bc8-e6. But black
                        prefers to meet the threat of Nc3-d5 with his
                        own threat, the move a7-a6 threatening to
                        capture the Nb5.

                        White's Nb5 is now under attack and has only
                        one logical retreat. White could play Bg5xf6,
                        meeting the threat on the Nb5 with a larger
                        threat, but black might simply recapture with
                        the g7-pawn. White therefore retreats the
                        Nb5-a3. Black responds with b7-b5, a move
                        that carries another threat, a pawn fork with
                        b5-b4.

                        White stops the threat of the pawn fork on
                        b4 simply by moving the Nc3 powerfully to
                        the central hole on d5. The black Nf6 dare
                        not capture the Nd5 because the Bg5 is pinning
                        it to the black Queen. Black therefore
                        responds with Bf8-e7, a move that carries
                        another threat, this time the move Nf6xNd5,
                        winning a piece!

                        Responding to the threat, white now plays

                        threat of Nf6xd5 and retaining the powerful
                        Nd5. To advance in chess, watch carefully for
                        such threats. Strong chess players develop
                        a finely honed sense of danger. Before you
                        move, always ask: "Does my opponent's
                        last move contain a threat?" If so, your move
                        should either stop the threat or, even better,
                        you should look for a threat that's even bigger.

                        Sometimes, the best way to meet a threat is
                        with an even bigger threat. In this position,
                        white has just made the move Nc3-d5. The
                        Nd5 threatens to capture the Qf6 and threatens
                        to play Nd5xc7 check, forking the black
                        King and the Ra8. You might expect black to
                        meet both threats with the move Qf6-d8,
                        removing the Queen from attack and using
                        the Queen to defend the c7-pawn.
                        Instead, black responds to the threat of
                        Nd5xc7 with a bigger threat: Qf6-g6.

                        take a look. If white is insensitive to the danger,
                        white might continue with Nd5xc7 check.
                        In check, black would move the King to d8.

                        black would be able to demonstrate that the
                        Qf6-g6 move had considerable bite. Black
                        continues with Qg6xg2.

                        threats, white must move the Rh1-f1. Black
                        would likely respond with the powerful move

                        In this position, black's advantage is pronounced.
                        The Nd5 is in the center the board
                        where it can't be attacked by white's pawns.
                        White's dark-squared Bishop on d2 is bad,
                        locked in by its own pawns. By contrast, the
                        black Bishop on d8 will have an important
                        role to play in black's attack on the Kingside.
                        Note that black's Rooks are actively doubled
                        on the g-file and the Qh6 is bearing down on
                        the white Kingside.
                        In an effort to relieve some of the pressure in
                        this position, white played Bc4xd5. Most chess
                        players would gladly recapture immediately
                        with the e6-pawn in order to undouble the
                        black e-pawns. But black has a much stronger
                        response with the move Rg5-h5.

                        Black suddenly has the huge threat of a check
                        with Rh5xh3+, forcing the white King to g2.
                        Then white can play Rh5-h2, checking the Kg2
                        and then winning the white Qf2 with check
                        when the King retreats to f1. Masters achieve
                        their strength in part because they consistently
