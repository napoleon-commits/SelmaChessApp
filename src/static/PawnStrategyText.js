        Unlike Kings, Queens, Bishops, Knights, and Rooks, pawns can move in only one direction: forward, ever forward. Reach the final rank and the lowly pawn, the foot soldier of chess, can transform itself into any piece except a King (players most often opt to promote to a Queen). But there is much more to pawns than just the quest to promote into a more powerful piece. As the pawns move forward, they open up diagonals for the Bishops, protect other pieces, and often lead the way for attacks. They can pry open an opponent's Kingside, but they can also spell doom when they become weak, and are then subject to capture.

                        on the f-file, while black has tripled pawns on the c-file. These pawns are weak because they cannot defend one another. If you were playing white, for example, you might attack the black pawns with Rooks along the c-file, and perhaps also with your other pieces. Black might decide to try to defend the pawns or, alternatively, attack the weak white doubled pawns.

                        Here, black has not one but two sets of doubled pawns. White's strategy is clear. White has doubled the white Rooks on the c-file and will, on the next move, capture the weak black pawn on c6. In contrast, the white pawn structure seems quite strong with no obvious weaknesses. As a result, black cannot easily mount a counterattack on white's position.

                        It is worth noting that there are many situations in which you need not be in rush to attack such weaknesses. By all means do so if you see a clear win as a result, as in this situa- tion, but keep in mind that weaknesses such as doubled pawns are "structural" in that the weaknesses will usually be there for the whole game, and you will easily be able to capture such pawns once all of your pieces are well developed.

                        Here, white has two pawn islands. Pawn islands consist of a single pawn or group of side-by-side pawns that are separated from other pawns by open files. The white pawns on the a-, b-, and c-files form one island, while the white pawns on the f-, g-, and h-files form the other island. Side-by-side, these pawns do not defend one another, but we consider these strong formations because, unlike the doubled pawns we just saw, they contain no permanent weaknesses and are capable of defending one another.

                        By contrast, the black pawns in this diagram form a total of four pawn islands and are considered much weaker. Three of the pawns have no neighbors. Therefore, if attacked, these pawns would need to be defended by Knights, Bishops, Rooks, or Queens, pieces that in most cases have more important roles to play than to defend a lowly pawn.
                        The general rule here is simple: During the game, try to have fewer pawn islands than your opponent.

                        In the following position, the black Knight has just captured on the e3 square. White could automatically recapture with the Queen to avoid doubling the white pawns on the e-file. A great American chess player, Frank Marshall, reached this position in a game against Abraham Kupchik in 1915. Marshall decided that capturing with the pawn had some advantages that outweighed the structural weakness of doubling the pawns.

                    Here is the position after the pawn capture. The new pawn on e3 helps to support the white center by defending the white d4-pawn. More important, by recapturing with the pawn, white has opened up the f-file for the Rook. To be sure, white now has four pawn islands while black has only two, but Marshall, who went on to win the game, felt that having both the Queen and the Rook on the open file and the strengthened center more than compensated for the doubled pawns and the extra pawn island.

If black responds by capturing white's e6-pawn (f7xe6), white will be able to respond with Queen to g6 to capture the middle pawn in the chain, simultaneously putting the King in check (Q3-g6+).

                        In this position, with black to move, the Knight can prevent the white a-pawn from promoting into a Queen by blockading the pawn. Move the Knight into the corner at a8, and you will prevent the further advance of the a-pawn.
                        Knights usually make the best blockaders. If you block a passed pawn with a more powerful piece, a Queen for example, the Queen would have to move off its blockading square if attacked by a piece of lesser value. The Knight makes the best blockader because it is the least valuable among the major (Queen and Rook) and minor (Bishop and Knight) pieces.

                        In this position, with black to move, black is considering the possibility of advancing the pawn on e6 to e5. The pawn move makes some sense. The pawn will move forward and force the white Knight on d4 to move. However, the pawn on e6 currently defends the d5 and f5 squares. If black advances the e-pawn to e5, both the d5 and f5 squares will become weak.

                        Here is the position after the advance of the black e-pawn. It is true that the white Knight on d4 must move, but white has the strong move Knight d4 to f5 (Nd4-f5). On f5, the white Knight attacks the black Bishop on e7 and places more pressure on what is now a backward black pawn on d6.

                        More important, perhaps, the advance of the black e-pawn has created a hole in the black pawn structure on the key central d5-square. For example, white is likely, within a few moves, to move the Knight on c3 into the hole on d5. Both of these key moves, Knight to f5 (Nd4-f5) and Knight to d5 (Nc3-d5), are possible because black decided to advance the e-pawn to e5. So keep in mind, all pawn moves create such weaknesses. Be sure to locate the weaknesses and consider their importance before you lash out with pawn moves.
